        <br>
        <hr>

        <section>
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>Norway is located on the western end of the Scandinavian Peninsula in northern Europe. It borders Sweden for the majority of its eastern border. Finnmark, the most northeast county of Norway, also borders Russia to the east and Finland to the south. To the west of Norway lies the Norwegian Sea. To the south lies the Skagerakk Straight. The Artic Ocean marks Norways northern coastline. Norway also claims the island of Svalbard, located to the north, and Jan Mayen, located to the west. The capital of Norway is Oslo.</p>

        <h2>Sub-Divisions</h2>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Kingdom</h3>
            <p>The Kingdom of Norway is the official name of Norway. The Kingdom includes "Metropolitan Norway", Svalbard, and Jan Mayen. Its Antartic claims are considered "dependencies" and are therefore not included.</p>
            <h3>Counties</h3>
            <p>There are 15 counties which make up Metropolitan Norway. These are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Oslo</li>
                <li>Rogaland</li>
                <li>Møre og Romsdal</li>
                <li>Nordland</li>
                <li>Østfold</li>
                <li>Akershus</li>
                <li>Buskerud</li>
                <li>Innlandet</li>
                <li>Vestfold</li>

                <li>Finnmark</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Municipalities</h3>
            <p>There are 357 municipalities which make up the 15 counties. Oslo, on account of being the capital, is both a county and a municipality.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
            <h3>Informal Divisions</h3>
            <p>Norway is also commonly divided into 5 regions. These regions are not federally recognised or used, however are often use colloquially in informal setting. These are most often:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Northern Norway</li>
                <li>Western Norway</li>
                <li>Eastern Norway</li>
                <li>Southern Norway</li>
                <li>Trøndelag</li>
            </ol>
            </section>
        <br>
        <section>
        <h2>Landscape</h2>
        <p>The majority of the Scandinavian Mountains lie within Norway. These mountains make up the majority of inner Norway. When these mountains reach the coast, they create fjords, which Norway is famous for. Northern Norway shares the same rugged terrain as the south. The further north you go, the islands off the coast of the many fjords get bigger. Tundras also become more common inland, as northern Norway lies past the Artic Circle.</p>

        <section>
        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>Due to its northern latitude and mountainous landscape, Norway has a reputation for being extremely cold. Cold winds blow in from the Artic, cooling the north. Winds follow the Gulf Stream to the Norwegian coast, which chills the western coastline. The mountains inland protect from these winds, however the high elevation results in cold temperatures as well. Summer temperatures in southern Norway typically range from 12°C to 18°C (53°F to 64°F). In northern Norway, they range from -10°C to 0°C (14°F to 32°F). Temperatures rarely change from summer to winter in the north. In southern Norway, winter temperatures reach as low as -3°C to 7°C (26°F to 45°F). Inland regions are much colder than the coasts, despite ocean winds.</p>
